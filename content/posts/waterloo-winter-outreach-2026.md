WATERLOO, ON — On the coldest day of the year, as Ontario experienced record-breaking low temperatures, Ramadan Giving brought together more than 60 volunteers to prepare, pack, and distribute 180 hot meals and 250 winter kits to support unhoused community members across Waterloo and Kitchener. Volunteers and supporters raised over $2,500 to provide these crucial items to those who need them in the area.

Hosted at the Chandler Mowat Community Centre, the initiative marked Ramadan Giving's first winter outreach event in Waterloo. The event was made possible through collaboration with Rommana Café, Muslim Social Services Waterloo, and Wijhah Initiative, who supported logistics, additional volunteers, promotion, and donations. Working together, the organizations ensured essential resources reached individuals during a period of extreme cold, highlighting the impact of coordinated, on-the-ground volunteer efforts in responding to the needs of the unhoused during severe weather.

> "We saw a need to bring support to unhoused communities not just in the GTA but also in Waterloo," said Nora Abdalaal, Founder and CEO at Ramadan Giving. "This work goes beyond distributing supplies. It's about ensuring people feel seen, respected, and supported, especially during moments of extreme hardship. It's always a privilege to work alongside organizations and volunteers who show up when the need is greatest."

## What Was Distributed

Over the course of the day, volunteers prepared and distributed:

- **180 freshly cooked hot meals** and hot chocolate
- **250 winter kits**, including blankets, feminine hygiene kits, water bottles, thermal socks, hand warmers, hats, gloves, and scarves
- Non-perishable food items
- **11 large bags** of donated clothing, including winter boots and jackets

Following preparation, volunteer teams dispersed throughout the Waterloo–Kitchener area to deliver hot meals, winter kits, and supplies directly to individuals in need. Despite the severe weather conditions, volunteers remained committed to reaching as many people as possible. Remaining donations were given out to shelters in the area, such as Safe Haven, oneROOF, and Ray of Hope Inc.

> "This was the coldest day we have seen, and we encountered people in real need throughout the day," said Zainib Nazir, VP, Ramadan Giving. "Being able to respond, even in small ways, is a privilege. Our volunteers stepped forward with so much compassion, and it reminds us that community-led support is built through action."
