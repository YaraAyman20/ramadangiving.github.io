## A Year of Unprecedented Generosity

2025 has been nothing short of extraordinary for Ramadan Giving. Thanks to the unwavering support of our community, we've achieved milestones that seemed impossible just a few years ago.

### The Numbers Speak for Themselves

This Ramadan, our community came together to create real, measurable impact:

- **1,965 lunch bags** distributed to those in need across the GTA
- **530 winter kits** provided to families facing the cold
- **$108,000+** raised specifically for Gaza emergency relief
- **370 food packages** delivered in Cairo to vulnerable families
- **174 children** enjoyed our summer camp programs

> "Every act of kindness, no matter how small, creates ripples of change that touch countless lives." — A Ramadan Giving Volunteer

### Behind the Numbers: Real Stories

These statistics represent real people with real stories. Like the single mother in Scarborough who received winter kits for her three children, or the elderly couple in Cairo who could finally celebrate Eid with a proper meal.

### Our Volunteers: The Heart of Our Mission

None of this would be possible without our incredible team of over **200 volunteers** who dedicated their time, energy, and hearts to this cause. From packing food boxes at 5 AM to delivering meals across the city, their commitment is the foundation of everything we do.

### Looking Ahead

As we reflect on this remarkable year, we're already planning for 2026. Our goals are ambitious:

1. **Expand our reach** to serve 3,000+ families
2. **Launch new programs** for youth education and empowerment
3. **Strengthen our Cairo operations** to serve more communities
4. **Build sustainable partnerships** with local organizations

### How You Can Help

The spirit of Ramadan is one of giving and community. Here's how you can continue to make a difference:

- **Donate** — Every dollar counts toward our mission
- **Volunteer** — Join our growing family of volunteers
- **Spread the word** — Share our mission with friends and family
- **Partner with us** — Organizations can collaborate on initiatives
