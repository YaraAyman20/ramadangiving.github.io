## Creating Moments of Joy

In a world where so many children face hardship, creating moments of pure, unbridled joy is more important than ever. Our Children's Camp Day 2025 did exactly that — bringing smiles to 174 young faces across two continents.

### Two Cities, One Mission

This year's camp was our most ambitious yet, running simultaneously in:

**Greater Toronto Area (GTA)**
- 111 children ages 6-14
- Held at community centers across the city
- Activities included sports, arts & crafts, and team building

**Cairo, Egypt**
- 63 children including Gazan evacuees
- Partnered with local organizations
- Special programs for displaced children

### A Day in the Life

Here's what a typical camp day looked like:

**Morning Session**
- 🎨 Creative arts and crafts
- 🏃 Sports and outdoor games
- 📚 Storytime and learning activities

**Afternoon Session**
- 🎭 Drama and performance workshops
- 🎮 Team-building games
- 🎉 Celebration and awards ceremony

### Special Focus: Gazan Evacuee Children

Among the children in our Cairo camp were **23 young evacuees from Gaza**. For many of these children, this was their first experience of carefree play in months.

> "Seeing the children laugh and play, forgetting their troubles even for a day — that's why we do this work." — Cairo Camp Volunteer

Our team worked with trauma-informed specialists to ensure these children received the extra care and attention they needed.

### The Impact

Beyond the fun, our camp programs have lasting effects:

- **Building confidence** through achievement and recognition
- **Creating connections** with peers and mentors
- **Developing skills** in teamwork and creativity
- **Providing respite** for families facing challenges

### Volunteer Heroes

Our camp was staffed by over **50 dedicated volunteers** who:

- Underwent background checks and training
- Planned age-appropriate activities
- Provided one-on-one support when needed
- Created a safe, inclusive environment for all children

### Looking Ahead: Summer Camp 2026

Based on the success of this year's program, we're already planning an expanded camp for summer 2026:

- **Extended duration** — Full week program
- **More locations** — Additional sites in both cities
- **New activities** — Swimming, field trips, and more
- **Scholarship program** — Ensuring no child is turned away

### How to Get Involved

**Volunteer**: Camp counselors and activity leaders needed
**Sponsor a Child**: $250 covers one child's full camp experience
**Donate Supplies**: Art supplies, sports equipment, and snacks

Every child deserves a chance to just be a kid. Help us make more of these moments possible.

*Building bridges of hope, one smile at a time.* 😊
