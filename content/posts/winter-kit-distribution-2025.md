## Keeping Our Community Warm

Canadian winters are beautiful, but they can be brutal — especially for families struggling to make ends meet. When the temperature drops below -20°C, staying warm isn't a luxury; it's survival.

This year, Ramadan Giving distributed **530 winter kits** to families across the Greater Toronto Area, our largest winter initiative to date.

### What's in a Winter Kit?

Each kit is carefully assembled to provide essential warmth:

| Item | Quantity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Winter jacket | 1 per person | Primary warmth |
| Thermal underlayers | 2 sets | Layering protection |
| Wool socks | 3 pairs | Foot warmth |
| Insulated gloves | 1 pair | Hand protection |
| Winter hat | 1 | Head warmth |
| Scarf | 1 | Neck protection |
| Hand warmers | 10 packs | Emergency warmth |

**Total value per kit: Approximately $200**

### The Distribution Process

Getting winter kits to those who need them most requires careful planning:

**Phase 1: Needs Assessment**
- Partner with social workers and community organizations
- Identify families most in need
- Gather sizing information for personalized kits

**Phase 2: Assembly**
- Source quality items at discounted rates
- Organize packing events with volunteers
- Customize kits based on family composition

**Phase 3: Distribution**
- Schedule pick-up appointments
- Arrange delivery for those who can't travel
- Provide extra support as needed

### By the Numbers

This year's winter kit distribution:

- 🧥 **530 complete kits** assembled and distributed
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Approximately 2,000 individuals** served
- 🤝 **85 volunteers** participated
- 📍 **12 distribution points** across the GTA
- ⏱️ **3 weeks** from assembly to final delivery

### Partner Spotlight: Winter Warmth Coalition

We couldn't do this alone. Special thanks to our partners:

- **Local businesses** who provided discounts on bulk purchases
- **Schools** who organized coat drives
- **Religious institutions** who served as distribution points
- **Corporate sponsors** who funded complete kit purchases

### Stories from the Field

**The Single Mom**

Maria, a single mother of three, was laid off just as winter approached. "I didn't know how I was going to keep my kids warm," she shared. "These kits were a blessing — my children can now walk to school without freezing."

**The New Immigrant Family**

The Rahman family arrived from Bangladesh in September, their first Canadian winter ahead of them. "We had no idea it could get this cold," Mr. Rahman laughed. "We're so grateful for this support."

### Looking Ahead: Winter 2026

We're already planning for next year with ambitious goals:

1. **750 kits** — 40% increase from this year
2. **Extended coverage** — Reaching more suburban areas
3. **Earlier distribution** — Starting in October before cold hits
4. **Children's program** — Special kits designed for kids
