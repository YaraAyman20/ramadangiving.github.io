## Warmth & Hope in Downtown Toronto

On December 27, Ramadan Giving volunteers came together in downtown Toronto to distribute winter kits to individuals experiencing homelessness. Each kit included warm clothing, sleeping bags, winter essentials, hygiene items, and hot meals to help keep people safe and comfortable during the cold season.

Our volunteers also prepared and handed out fresh sandwiches, bringing not just nourishment but care and connection to those we served.

This initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to support vulnerable communities and ensure that everyone has access to warmth, essentials, and a sense of dignity during the winter months.

Thank you to all our volunteers and supporters who helped make this day possible. Together, we're spreading hope and compassion across Toronto.
