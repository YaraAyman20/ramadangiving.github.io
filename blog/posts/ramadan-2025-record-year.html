        2025 marked an extraordinary milestone for Ramadan Giving. Through the unwavering dedication of our volunteers 
        and the generous support of our community, we achieved record-breaking numbers across all our programs.

    <h2>GTA Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        In the Greater Toronto Area, our teams distributed <strong>1,965 lunch bags</strong> to those experiencing 
        food insecurity, <strong>530 winter kits</strong> to help families stay warm during the cold months, and 
        <strong>460 food packages</strong> to households in need.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also served over <strong>430 hot meals</strong> to unhoused community members and distributed 
        <strong>150+ toy bags</strong> to bring joy to children during the holiday season.

    <blockquote>
        "The spirit of giving knows no bounds. Every lunch bag, every winter kit, every smile we bring 
        represents a connection—a reminder that we are all part of one community."

    <h2>Children's Camp Day</h2>
    <p>
        Our annual camp day brought together <strong>111 children</strong> for a day filled with activities, 
        games, and memorable experiences. It's moments like these that remind us why we do what we do.
    </p>

    <h2>Gaza Relief Efforts</h2>
    <p>
        In response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, our community came together like never before, 
        raising over <strong>$108,000</strong> for relief efforts. These funds are providing essential 
        supplies, medical aid, and support to families affected by the conflict.
    </p>

    <h2>Egypt Operations</h2>
    <p>
        Our Cairo team distributed <strong>370 food packs</strong> and <strong>330 meat packs</strong> to 
        vulnerable families. We also hosted a camp day for <strong>63 children</strong>, including Gazan 
        evacuees who found temporary refuge in Egypt.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>
        As we reflect on this incredible year, we're filled with gratitude for every volunteer, donor, and 
        community member who made this possible. Together, we're not just providing aid—we're building 
        bridges of hope that connect communities across continents.
