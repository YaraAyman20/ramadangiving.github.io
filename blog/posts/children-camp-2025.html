        This year's camp day was our most impactful yet, bringing joy and celebration to 174 children 
        across two continents. In the GTA, 111 children enjoyed a day of activities, while in Cairo, 
        63 children—including Gazan evacuees—experienced the magic of community and belonging.

    <h2>A Day of Joy in the GTA</h2>
    <p>
        Our Toronto camp day transformed a local community center into a wonderland of activities. 
        Children participated in arts and crafts, sports, games, and special performances. The highlight 
        of the day was the closing ceremony where each child received a gift bag filled with toys and treats.

    <h2>Cairo: A Special Mission</h2>
    <p>
        This year's Cairo camp held special significance. Among the 63 children we served were families 
        who had evacuated from Gaza and found temporary refuge in Egypt. For these children, the camp 
        offered a rare day of normalcy amid extraordinary circumstances.

        Our Cairo team, in partnership with local organizations, provided:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full meals and refreshments throughout the day</li>
        <li>Educational activities and games</li>
        <li>Psychological support activities designed for children who have experienced trauma</li>
        <li>Gift bags with school supplies, toys, and clothing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Power of Play</h2>
    <p>
        Research shows that play is essential for children's development and well-being, especially 
        during times of stress. Our camp days are designed to provide not just entertainment, but 
        meaningful experiences that support emotional health and build lasting memories.

    <h2>Volunteer Heroes</h2>
    <p>
        None of this would be possible without our incredible volunteers. Over 50 volunteers across 
        both locations dedicated their time and energy to making this day special. From face painting 
        to organizing games, their enthusiasm was contagious.

        <strong>Every child deserves to feel joy. Thank you for helping us deliver it.</strong>
